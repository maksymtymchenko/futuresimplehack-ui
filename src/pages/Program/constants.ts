export const READING = `Grandpa shouts, "Dinner's ready" in Danish. My mother asks me in English to lay the table. As I do so, I catch the theme tune of the Brazilian soap opera on TV in the living room, where my sister is relaxing. She speaks perfect Portuguese. My father asks her to record the program in his native Spanish, and we take our places at the table. And what's on the menu? Italian meatballs.
We know we aren't a normal family. At any moment, you might hear conversations in four different languages, and almost everyone understands almost everything.
But what is normal these days? My mother is half-Danish, half-English, and my father, who is from Bolivia, speaks Spanish and Guarani. Because of my mother's work (she's now retired), we lived in Brazil, Italy, and Germany, so we picked up three more languages. Now as adults, my sister and I both speak six languages.
Being bilingual, or in our case multilingual, has so many advantages. All the recent research suggests we benefit in many ways: social, cultural, economic, academic, and intellectual. The research has also destroyed some of those persistent myths.
One of the myths is that bilingualism is uncommon, as if we bilinguals are like rare, exotic birds. The truth is that around fifty percent of the world's inhabitants are bilingual. The continents with the most linguistic diversity are Asia and Africa. In Nigeria alone, 500 languages are spoken, in India 400.`;

Hi Hernan,

My name's Julia Brown. I heard from my friend Nichola Lazarus that you're running a Spanish conversation class. She said you'd be happy to accept a few more people. My mother tongue is English but I picked up some Spanish years ago when I was travelling in Latin America.

I really want to develop my fluency and accuracy, so l'd love to join the class. Hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,
Julia

export const NEW_DIRECTOR_EMAIL = `
Dear Colleagues,

As you probably know, next month I will start work as the new director of the Language Teaching Education Programme. For those of you who don't know me, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. Since 2010, I have worked at the School of Education at Borodive University. I have been involved in a number of language teacher education projects across Europe and I worked extensively on the Star Placement Initiative that placed six thousand native speakers in language classrooms in eight countries. I am married with two children and my family is bilingual in English and Turkish.

I look forward to working with you.

Yours sincerely,
Talya Osman
